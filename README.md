-	[Targets user manual](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/): No explanation needed.
- [Targets for Ecologists](https://targets-ecology.netlify.app/): A worked example of applying the targets package to an ecological data set, complete with explanations of each step.
- [Tarchetypes package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tarchetypes/index.html): This package is an extension of the Targets package that expands its functionality. I found the tar_map() function to be particularly useful.
